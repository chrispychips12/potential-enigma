USER STORY

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

When a command-line application that accepts user input, I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

In this project:
- I have installed all required dependencies
- Create a .gitignore file for node modules
- Utilized back end functions to create a running application
- Utilized inquirer package
- Created functions to generate read.me file from user input
- Created a function to initialize the app
- Created a function that returns a license badge when inputted
-   With a function to also return empty when there is no input
- Created a function that returns the license link
-   With a function to also return empty when there is no input
- Created a function that returns the licence section of README
- Created a function to generate the markdown for the README
- Created a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the README generator 
- Created a walkthrough video that demonstrates how a user would invoke the application from the command line.
- Created a walkthrough video that demonstrates how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.
- Created a walkthrough video that demonstrates a generated README that matches the user input and has a functioning table of contents.
